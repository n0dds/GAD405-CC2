# GAD 405 Assignment 2: Radical Conversion
## Starter code, version 1.0

This is the starter code for the second GAD 405 assignment.
Fork and clone this repository.

Then choose one of the three projects.

Project 1: Endless Runner (Flappy Bird)

Project 2: 2D-Shooter (Space Invaders)

Project 3: RPG

Use this code as your starting point to create a radical conversion as detailed in the assignment brief. Remember: all assets have to be self-made.

For audio assets this means: You can use software like GarageBand, Ableton, pure data or bfxr and the synthesizers / sound libraries these programs provide to create music and sound for your game. You cannot use prerecorded sound or music files created by someone else.

Same rules for graphical assets: You can draw everything yourself or produce graphical artwork with a software program (p5.js for example). You cannot take any graphics created by someone else.

Use an up-to date browser, e.g. Firefox or Chrome.

Note: If you are using the Tiled map editor, do not forget to embed your tileset in the tilemap before you export to the Json map file format. If you change anything in the tilemap, you just need to export again.
